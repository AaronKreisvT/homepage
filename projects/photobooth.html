      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>As a broke physics student with a love for DIY and tinkering, I couldn't justify spending hundreds of euros on a commercial photo booth for parties and events. So, I built my own — using the tools and knowledge I already had.</p>
      <p>This project is a <strong>self-made photo booth</strong>, built around a wooden frame, a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen, and a Nikon DSLR camera connected via USB. The result is a compact, reliable, and fun little system that lets guests take high-quality photos with a single tap — and instantly get their picture via a personal QR code.</p>
      <p>The software is kept intentionally lightweight and modular:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>client side</strong> (running on the Raspberry Pi) handles image capture, display, and upload.</li>
        <li>The <strong>server side</strong> hosts a simple website where guests can retrieve their photos by scanning the QR code.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No accounts, no cloud services, no ads — just local hardware, open protocols, and full control.<br>
The booth has already been used at birthdays, graduation parties, and student events — and it's always a hit.</p>
