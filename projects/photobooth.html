        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
          As a broke physics student with a love for DIY and tinkering, I
          couldn't justify spending hundreds of euros on a commercial photo
          booth for parties and events. So, I built my own — using the tools and
          knowledge I already had.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is a <strong>self-made photo booth</strong>, built around
          a wooden frame, a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen, and a Nikon DSLR
          camera connected via USB. The result is a compact, reliable, and fun
          little system that lets guests take high-quality photos with a single
          tap — and instantly get their picture via a personal QR code.
        </p>
        <p>The software is kept intentionally lightweight and modular:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <strong>client side</strong> (running on the Raspberry Pi)
            handles image capture, display, and upload.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>server side</strong> hosts a simple website where guests
            can retrieve their photos by scanning the QR code.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          No accounts, no cloud services, no ads — just local hardware, open
          protocols, and full control.<br />
          The booth has already been used at birthdays, graduation parties, and
          student events — and it's always a hit.
        </p>
        <h2>To Do</h2>
        <ol></ol>
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <h3>Front View</h3>
        <p>
          This is the front view of the photo booth. It features a custom-built
          wooden enclosure with a camera opening and a 10.1" Waveshare LCD
          touchscreen display. An LED strip with an integrated diffuser is
          mounted around the front and was originally used as a flash. However,
          since the light was coming directly from the front, it was reflected
          in eyeglass lenses, making the LED strips and their geometric pattern
          clearly visible in the photos. To solve this issue, I added a ring
          light on top of the box, which now provides static illumination and
          results in much more natural reflections. The booth is mounted on a
          tripod with independently adjustable legs, allowing the height and
          tilt to be adjusted easily. Internally, the entire assembly is secured
          with a wing screw to ensure stable support. <br />
